# Arushanth_OS
Welcome Arushanth OS is a minimal real-mode operating system developed in x86 Assembly. It demonstrates the basics of the boot process by printing a welcome message using BIOS interrupts. This is my first step into understanding how operating systems work at the lowest level â€” starting right from the bootloader.  


Tools Used

- Ubuntu 24.04 via WSL
- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- QEMU (Quick Emulator)

Overview
This is my first attempt to build an operating system from scratch to understand how low-level software works, including:
BIOS interrupt handling
Boot sector structure
x86 Assembly basics
